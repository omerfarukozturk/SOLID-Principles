 ### Open/Closed Principle
 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)

 "Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
 
 "A class is closed, since it may be compiled, stored in a library, baselined, and used by client classes. But it is also open, since any new class may use it as parent, adding new features. When a descendant class is defined, there is no need to change the original or to disturb its clients."
 
 
 There are two example in "**Sources**" folder:
 * **Before.swift**: A default version of example impelemtation.
 * **After.swift**: SRP applied version.
